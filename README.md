## Credits
Originally started as a [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) configuration and slowly started changing plugins, options and structure.
I'm unimaginably thankful for [NormalNvim](https://github.com/NormalNvim/NormalNvim)'s excellent codebase and helpful comments.
Equal thanks go to [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim)'s website and codebase, both of which are great for discovery.

Special thanks to ThePrimeagen and TJ DeVries for making my move to Neovim feasible.

Hopefully one day I can contribute to this incredible tool.

## Roadmap

### Todos
* Adding Markdown and JSON linting and autoformatting
* Adding [Neotest](https://github.com/nvim-neotest/neotest) to handle testing
* Writing more comments throught the code
* Making some functionality more modular by better checking for any other plugins its using
* Adding Hyprland lang support
